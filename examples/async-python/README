An example of abstracting glib-style callbacks into asyncio method calls.

`qmi_obj.py` provides a base class that uses dynamic attributes to turn glib
method calls into a regular method call on a python object. It provides a sample
subclass `SmsClient` that further abstracts a sample of sms operations to be
more python-esque.

`qmi_async.py` uses the classes defined in `qmi_obj.py` to create a command-line
client.

Note that the program requires libqmi-glib to be installed in the system
and the introspection typelibs available in the standard paths.

Have fun!
